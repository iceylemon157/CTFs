# CTFlearn Rangoon

First of all, we pass CTFlearn{whatever} to our binary.
From GDB we can obtain CTFlearn{Prince_Princess_Thaketa}, but it told us it's not the flag.
We can learn that the flag length have to be 0x1c = 28.
From the code slightly above(generated by Ghidra), we can notice that there are code such as:        
```asm
CMP           byte ptr [R14  + 0x11 ],0x5f
CMP           byte ptr [R14  + 0x16 ],0x5f
CMP           sVar5 ,0x1c
```
This meant that our flag will be different if we have different value on R14+0x11.
Since we know ```chr(0x5f)=_```, we can try to make flag[18] as '_'.
After fulfilling 2 other condition, we can get our flag.
FLAG:```CTFlearn{Princess_Maha_Devi}```
